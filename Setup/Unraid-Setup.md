## (Optional) Change the Config Path
If desired, you can specify a custom path for the OliveTin configuration folder.

## Apply the Settings
After making your desired changes, click on Apply. At this point, the container will attempt to launch. Although it may not find the config.yaml file yet, it will create the directory where your configuration files should be placed

## Create and Upload your config.yaml
Once the configuration folder is established, create your config.yaml file. Upload it to the designated folder. For detailed guidance on creating the config.yaml, refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.olivetin.app/index.html) 

## Test the Setup
At this point, your OliveTin container should be configured with all necessary parameters to function correctly. To verify that everything is working as expected, start the container and check for any errors or issues. Ensure that the application loads properly and that your configuration settings are being applied correctly.
