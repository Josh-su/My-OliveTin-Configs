## [Config-1](Config-1/README.md)
This configuration enables the **Filtered Container** feature, where action buttons are activated or deactivated based on the `container.State` variable. This allows for a dynamic user experience, displaying relevant options depending on the current state of the container.

## [Config-2](Config-2/README.md) *(Work in Progress - Not Functional)*
An extension of Config-1, this configuration aims to introduce additional functionality by adding local user management. It features two distinct dashboards:
- **Guest Dashboard**: Displays filtered containers for guest users/groups, showing only relevant information and actions.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Provides access to all containers for admin users/groups, allowing full visibility and control.

*Note: This configuration is currently a work in progress and is not yet functional.*
